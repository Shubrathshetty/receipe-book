# Recipe Book 

A lightweight, multi-page recipe browser built with Vite and Vue 3. It ships with 150+ preloaded recipes, rich filtering/search, saved (bookmarked) lists, and guided detail pages with ingredients, step tracking, speech, and quick YouTube lookups.

## Features
- **Multi-page**: `index.html` (shelf) and `recipe.html` (detail) served via Vite multi-entry build.
- **Large dataset**: 150+ recipes in `data.js`, each with images and autogenerated YouTube search links.
- **Search & Filters**: Full-text search plus quick chips (Quick, Veggie, Comfort, Sweet, Weeknight).
- **Saved list**: Bookmarks persist in `localStorage` and surface in a dedicated "Saved recipes" strip.
- **Guided cooking**: Step navigator with progress, speech synthesis, ingredient checkboxes, and hover-free cards.
- **Styling**: Food-themed background, 3D buttons, responsive grid, lazy-loaded images with fallbacks.

## Run locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# build
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## What I practiced / learned
- Getting comfortable with **Git pulls and resolving merge conflicts** while iterating rapidly on a front-end project.
- Setting up a **Vite multi-page** build (custom rollup inputs) and handling base paths for navigation.
- Using **Vue 3 (composition API)** without a heavy router for a small multi-page flow.
- Managing **localStorage** state for bookmarks and last-opened recipe continuity.
- Handling **robust media loading** (image fallbacks, YouTube search links) to avoid broken embeds.
- Applying **progressive enhancement** (speech synthesis, lazy loading) while keeping no-build fallbacks minimal.

## Project structure
- `index.html` / `index.js` – Shelf grid, search/filters, saved strip.
- `recipe.html` / `recipe.js` – Detail page with ingredients, steps, speech, bookmarks, and YouTube search CTA.
- `data.js` – Recipe dataset and asset URLs.
- `vite.config.js` – Multi-entry build config and Vue bundler flags.
- `public/favicon.ico` – Favicon placeholder (replace with your icon).

## Customization tips
- Swap the background image by editing `--bg-gif` in `index.html` and `recipe.html`.
- Replace the favicon by dropping your icon into `public/favicon.ico`.
- If you want fixed tutorial videos per recipe, add a `video` field in `data.js`; otherwise the YouTube search link is generated from the title.

## Deployment
`npm run build` produces static assets in `dist/`. Serve that folder on any static host (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages). The config already includes both entry points.
